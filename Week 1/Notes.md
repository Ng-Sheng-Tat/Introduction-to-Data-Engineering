## Week 1
**The value of data** depends on the accuracy and the accessibility of the data.
**Data processing** workflow
1. Data Collection (Structured and unstructured)
  - deals with security, integrity, and reliability of data
2. Data processing
  - optimization, standardization, and cleaning to ensure compliance
3. Data management
  - for stakeholders, APPS, programmers analysts, data science uses cases
  - emerging technologies include cloud computing, machine learning, and big data

**Data Engineers** are people who develop and maintain data architectures and make data available for business operations and analysis. Data Engineers work within the data ecosystem to **extract, integrate, and organize data from disparate sources; clean, transform, and prepare data; design, store, and manage data in data repositories**. They enable data to be accessible in formats and systems that the various business applications, as well as stakeholders like Data Analysts and Data Scientists, can utilize. A Data Engineer must have **good knowledge of programming, sound knowledge of systems and technology architectures, and in-depth understanding of relational databases and non-relational datastores**.

A **Data Analyst** **translates data and numbers into plain language, so organizations can make decisions**. Data Analysts **inspect, and clean data for deriving insights; identify correlations, find patterns, and apply statistical methods to analyze and mine data; and visualize data to interpret and present the findings of data analysis**. Analysts are the people who answer questions such as “Are the users’ search experiences generally good or bad with the search functionality on our site” or “What is the popular perception of people regarding our rebranding initiatives” or “Is there a correlation between sales of one product and another." Data Analysts **require good knowledge of spreadsheets, writing queries, and using statistical tools to create charts and dashboards**. Modern data analysts also need to have some programming skills. They need strong analytical and story-telling skills.

**Data Scientists** **analyze data for actionable insights and build Machine Learning or Deep Learning models that train on past data to create predictive models**. Data Scientists are people who answer questions such as “How many new social media followers am I likely to get next month?” or “What percentage of my customers am I likely to lose to competition in the next quarter” or “Is this financial transaction unusual for this customer?”. Data Scientists **require knowledge of Mathematics, Statistics, and a fair understanding of programming languages, databases, and building data models. They also need to have domain knowledge**.

**Business Analysts and BI Analysts**. Business Analysts **leverage the work of Data Analysts and Data Scientists to look at possible implications for their business and the actions they need to take or recommend**. **BI Analysts** do the same, except their focus is on the market **forces and external influences that shape their business**. They provide business intelligence solutions by organizing and monitoring data on different business functions and exploring that data to extract insights and actionables that improve business performance.

To summarize in simple terms, **Data Engineering converts raw data into usable data**. **Data Analytics uses this data to generate insights**. **Data Scientists use Data Analytics and Data Engineering to predict the future using data from the past**. **Business Analysts and Business Intelligence Analysts use these insights and predictions to drive decisions that benefit and grow their business**.

**Data Engineer** provides **analytics-ready** data, which are accurate, reliable, complies to regulations, accessible to consumers. It is a field on a combination of computer science and data science. 

**Skills for Data Engineers**
Knowledge of working with **operating systems** such as UNIX, Linux, and Windows, including commonly used administrative tools, system utilities and commands. Knowledge of **infrastructure components**, such as virtual machines, networking, and application services, such as load balancing and application performance monitoring. Also, **cloud-based services** such as those offered by Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft. Experience of working with **databases and data warehouses**, which include: RDBMSes such as IBM DB2, MySQL, Oracle Database, and PostgreSQL. NoSQL databases such as Redis, MongoDB, Cassandra, and Neo4J. Data warehouses such as Oracle Exadata, IBM Db2 Warehouse on Cloud, IBM Netezza Performance Server, and Amazon RedShift. A high-level of proficiency working with data pipelines. Popular data pipeline solutions include Apache Beam, AirFlow, and DataFLow. Experience of working with ETL tools such as IBM Infosphere Information Server, AWS Glue, and Improvado. **Proficiency in languages** for querying, manipulating, and processing data. This includes: Query languages for accessing and manipulating data in a database, such as SQL for relational databases and SQL-like query languages for NoSQL databases. Programming languages such as Python, R, and Java. Shell and **Scripting languages**, such as Unix/Linux Shell and PowerShell. Familiarity with **Big Data processing tools** such as Hadoop, Hive, and Spark. The data engineering process involves using several different tools and technologies. Having a working knowledge of comparable technologies can help you evaluate the trade-offs between different tools and make appropriate recommendations. Data engineering is at the intersection of software engineering and data science. In addition to the tools and technologies that data engineers use on a daily basis, they also need to have a keen understanding of how data scientists, analysts, and business users leverage analysis-ready data.

Some of the functional skills that will serve you as a Data Engineer, include: **The ability to convert business requirements into technical specifications**. The ability to work with the complete software development lifecycle which includes ideation, architecture, design, prototyping, testing, deployment, and monitoring. An understanding of data’s potential application in business. And an understanding of the risks of poor data management which essentially covers data quality, privacy, security, and compliance. Data engineering is a team sport. You could have multiple data engineers bringing in their specialization to collaborate on a project, closely interacting with the data consumers—which includes the analysts, data scientists, business users, and other technical teams. **Interpersonal skills, teamwork, and collaboration, therefore, are essential for data engineers**. As a data engineer, you need to be able to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders in a manner that a clear understanding can be established. In this video, you learned about some of the responsibilities and skillsets of a data engineer. Data engineering requires a broad set of skillsets. No one data engineer can possibly master each one of these skills, which means you essentially need to select one or more specialization areas, but have a good understanding of all areas so that you can make more informed decisions. Your skills will grow over time with experience, the areas you choose to focus on, and the time you invest in upskilling yourself.
